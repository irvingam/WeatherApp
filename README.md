# WeatherApp

- This is a weather app created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- My first time working with APIs and using JS to connect the weather API to the app.

- Users can enter a city into the input at the top of the page and press enter.

- The location, date, current temperature, current weather, and hi and low temperatures.

- All temperatures are displayed in metric.
